How to use InputTxt:
	1)Create an object:
		InputTxt <object name> = new InputTxt();

	2)To get a line of text:
		<object name>.getLine();

	3)Capturing input: 	
		String a=<object name>.getLine();
		This can also be accessed by view the text files created in 
		the JRepl directory. Each instance of InputTxt is given a 
		unique Id.

	Always create a new object for each time you want to get input. This is 
	to avoid a String reading newer input which may not be what you inteded.  

	Note that InputTxt is a very barebones class for getting input and is
	not intended to be a major part of JRepl. It is only included for the 
	sake of a complete Java experience. JRepl is intended for simpler
	execution of simple code. I hope you keep it that way.
	
	That being said, if you feel like you want more methods with InputTxt, feel 
	free to edit the InputTxt.java file and contact me if you think I should 
	include your edits in the main repo. 
	
	Currently InputTxt is only supported on windows as it uses a .bat file to get
	input. A workaround to simulate text input is by editing the InputTxt.java file
	and adding a method that uses readfile() to read a specific text file in your 
	JRepl directory. During the execution of your program, edit the text file to 
	simulate text input.
