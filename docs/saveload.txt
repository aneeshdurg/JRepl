Saving and Loading files in Jrepl:
	To save all current functions and Classes created in Jrepl, run the command:
		-save <filename>
	which will save your work to a file named <filename>.jrepl.

	To load a file run the command:
		-load <filename>
	Note that the .jrepl is OMITTED here. This is to prevent users from loading
	other types of files (like standard Java files).

	Although one can create .jrepl in a text editor of his or her choice, I do
	not reccomend doing so. However if you choose to do so, format the file with
	the following template:
		
		//:functions
		<Your functions>
		//:classes
		<Your classes>

	So that Jrepl knows where to append the content of the file.	
	To unload a loaded file, if it is causing problems, or if you've edited the file
	and wish to reload it, run:
		-load <filename>
	again and you will be prompted to unload the file.
