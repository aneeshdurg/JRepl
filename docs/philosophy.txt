The philosophy of Jrepl(some notes for developers):

	Jrepl does not compile line by line, and is not supposed to. 
	Variables, objects, etc..., should be useable for the entire session.
	As such, Jrepl has several "hacks" to create the "illusion" of an REPL.
	The following is a list of these "hacks" and the rationale behind them.

	Dontprintme
		Dontprintme is appended to all classes and inserted as an argument to some functions
		in order to preserve the user's input while preventing print statements inside functions
		and classes from executing multiple times. The user is never made aware of this class
		and is strictly for internal use!

	InputTxt
		InputTxt is my workaround to being unable to use Scanners since the window in which the 
		prompt would be displayed is supressed. It requires OS dependant scripts and must store the 
		input to a text file. This class is provided for the user, but only provides base functionality,
		which is more than enough for the purposes of this program.

	CleanDir 
		CleanDir is a class which allows me to clean the directory without being OS dependant. Currently,
		CleanDir is somewhat problematic to work with, as it can't delete files which Java is writing to.
		This class is not inteded to be used by the user, but has been documented in the event that the 
		user feels like playing with files.

	Above all, Jrepl should maintain the illusion that the compilation and execution of the program	is
	happening on the main window. The average user should not be aware of the "hacks" behind it, and 
	should focus on using it as a tool for productivity and rapid thinking.
