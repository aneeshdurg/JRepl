JRepl commands:
	-help
		Displays this help message.
	-about 
		Displays the about.txt document which
		explains some of the motivations and
		details behind this project.
	-quine
		Displays the source code.
	-buffer
		Displays the previously written commands
		(does not update until next command is
		  written, this will cause it to see a 	
		  false version after -reset is called)
	-reset
		Resets all files, thus deleting previous
		commands, functions and classes.
	-import
		Tells JRepl to add the following packages
		to the compiler. See "Importing a package"
		below for full syntax.
	-InputTxt
		Documentation for the InputTxt class. See 
		"Getting user input" below for more details.
	-SaveLoad
		Instructions for saving and loading file in 
		Jrepl.

Function declarations:
	:function()
		or
	:<type> function()
		note:
		     only the following types can be used
		     with this syntax:
		     -int
		     -char
		     -double
		     -float
		     -boolean
		     -String
	Leaving the type blank at the prompt will use the type
	void by default. All functions are public static as of 
	now. Only one line can be entered without {}.

Creating a class:
	::newClass

Importing a package:
	-import <package name>

Displaying current commands:
	-buffer

Evaluating expressions:
	2+2
		or
	x+1
		or
	x==3
		note:
		     You do NOT need to type ; for these expressions 
		     to print. However, errors will not be thrown if
		     you do.

Getting user input:
	Although the purpose of JRepl is not to make full Java applications,
	I felt as though getting user input should be enabled. However, due to
	the nature of the JRepl compiler and output renderer, using the Scanner
	class would cause the program to freeze. As a result a very basic batch
	application has been integrated which can be called from the InputTxt class.
	Enter -InputTxt or open the file InputTxt.txt for more information.

Clearning directory:
	-reset should reset the environment, however, if this fails, the class 
	CleanDir is provided to delete all non-Jrepl files. We do not reccomend
	using this class over -reset and is included for internal operations.
	Syntax:
		CleanDir <name> = new CleanDir();
		<name>.run();

***ALL OTHER COMMANDS ARE STANDARD JAVA SYNTAX***
